Garmin IQ Data Field for displaying current speed and a +/- indicator showing how the current speed relates to the average speed for the current activity.  
  
TODO:
* "Speed" label is always white
* Main value font size is not as large as the stock data fields
* Draw better (custom?) status indicators, like arrow up/down and a dot instead of +/-/=/x
